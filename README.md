# Quick-Launcher

**Quick Launcher**

Quick Launcher was a startup project I decided to try after a while of learning web-development.
I decided to build a website where I could include logos and clickon links that redirect others to
popular social media sites, such as Reddit.

I **did** end up making more than I expected, adding in a semi-functional search bar, styled the page a little,
and it turned out to be a pretty succesfull and good project! :P

However, I did *not* include JavaScript as I couldn't seem to get a hold of the language.
But it's still good though! I'll try to incorporate a **little** bit. Slowly.

But, as an extremely "noob", or a newcomer to the web development scene, thank you for coming over to look at my website's source code!

*P.S. Messiest HTML you will ever see in your entire web-dev journey.*
