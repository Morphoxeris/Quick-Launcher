# Quick-Launcher

Quick Launcher was the first web-development project I attempted after weeks of trying to master HTML and CSS.

The original plan was to create a website where website-logo-shortcut-thingies would direct users to the website, and maybe throw
in a couple lines of JavaScript.

I did end up mastering more than expected, learning how to utilize footers and even ended up creating a textbox and styled it to make it
look like a search bar.
